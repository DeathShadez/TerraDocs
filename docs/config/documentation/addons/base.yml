        A sampler is a config defined function that world positions and the world seed to a set
        of output values.

        A 'sample' is defined as the value produced by a single calculation provided by a sampler. A collective set of
        samples is regarded as 'noise'.

        Noise produced by noise samplers :doc:`determine some kind of behaviour </config/development/noise/use>` for each block or column. This behaviour
        is dependent on the context of the sampler definition.
