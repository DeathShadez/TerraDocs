# Terra Docs

Documentation for [Terra](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Terra/).

Based on [Sponge](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeDocs)'s documentation tooling.

## Local Usage

## Set up

1. Clone this project locally.
2. Ensure installed:
   * Python 3.4+ for Sphinx and its dependencies.
   * Node.js & npm for gulp and its dependencies.
   * [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) for rendering diagrams.
3. Open project directory in a terminal
4. Set up python virtual environment (optional, recommended - if you want to install dependencies local rather than system-wide):
   * Run `python -m venv .venv` to create the virtual environment.
   * Activate the virtual environment, this depends on your system setup:
       * **Bash** - run `source .venv/bin/activate`
       * **Other setups** see [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work).
   * To leave the virtual environment in your shell, simply run `deactivate`
5. Install python packages
   * If you already have `pip` installed or are using a virtual environment run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   * Otherwise run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
       * Windows users: If you see a WARNING about adding the \Scripts folder to PATH, do it, then restart terminal.
   gulp
6. Install Node.js packages to project directory.
   * Run `npm install`

### Running

1. Open project directory in a terminal.
2. If you are using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it first (see step 4).
3. Run `npm exec gulp`

Gulp will open a browser window displaying the HTML generated by Sphinx for the reStructuredText documentation.
Changes made to documentation sources will automatically update the browser view.
