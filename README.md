# Terra Docs

Documentation for [Terra](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Terra/).

Based on [Sponge](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeDocs)'s documentation tooling.

## Usage

1. Setup the environment:
   * Python 3
   * node.js
2. Install tooling (in same directory as this README):
   * `pip` for Sphinx and its dependencies.
   * `npm` for Gulp and its dependencies.
   * [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) for rendering diagrams.
3. Install project dependencies and run:
   ```bash
   npm install -g gulp
   npm install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Windows users: If you see a WARNING about adding the \Scripts folder to PATH, do it, then restart terminal.
   gulp
   ```


Gulp will open a browser window displaying the HTML generated by Sphinx for the reStructuredText documentation.
Changes made to documentation sources will automatically update the browser view.
